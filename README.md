Certainly! Below is the complete **README.md** content in a single block that you can copy and paste into your `README.md` file for your MERN stack application (excluding MongoDB).

# MERN Stack Application (No MongoDB)

This is a **MERN** stack web application that utilizes **Node.js**, **Express**, and **React** for the backend and frontend, excluding MongoDB for data storage. Instead, the application uses alternative storage or manages state in memory.

## Features

- **React Frontend**: A modern, responsive user interface built using React.
- **Node.js Backend**: A backend built with Node.js and Express for handling API requests and serving the React app.
- **State Management**: Uses alternative methods like in-memory storage, local storage, or a file-based system for data persistence (if applicable).
- **REST API**: Provides RESTful API endpoints for communication between the frontend and backend.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - React
  - Axios (for API requests)
  - CSS/SCSS or styled-components for styling
- **Backend**: 
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
- **State Management**: 
  - In-memory data or alternative storage solutions (e.g., local files, session storage)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js** and **npm** installed.
- A code editor (e.g., **VS Code**).

You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

3. Install the dependencies for both the frontend and backend:
   - **Backend**:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```
   - **Frontend**:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     npm install
     ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend**:
   Navigate to the `backend` folder and run:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The server will start at `http://localhost:5000` (or your specified port).

2. **Start the Frontend**:
   Navigate to the `frontend` folder and run:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The React app will start at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

3. You should now be able to access the application by opening `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. The frontend communicates with the backend API to fetch and display data.

## API Endpoints

### GET `/api/items`
Fetches all items (replace with your own endpoints).

### POST `/api/items`
Adds a new item (replace with your own endpoints).

### PUT `/api/items/:id`
Updates an item by ID (replace with your own endpoints).

### DELETE `/api/items/:id`
Deletes an item by ID (replace with your own endpoints).

## Deployment

To deploy this app to production:

1. **Build the React app**:
   Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Serve the built app**:
   You can serve the production build using a static file server like `serve`, or you can configure Express to serve the static files.

   Example:
   ```bash
   npm install -g serve
   serve -s build
   ```
